# Usage

This page provides instructions for operating the UAM using the nodes in this repository.

## [Preflight safety checklist](preflight.md)

Before each flight, it's important to perform a series of checks to ensure that the UAM is safe to operate. Follow the procedures outlined in the [preflight.md](preflight.md) file to complete these checks.

## Additional procedures and troubleshooting

In addition to the preflight safety checklist, this page also contains documentation for other procedures that are necessary for operating the Borinot UAM. These include:

### [Optitrack fusion](optitrack.md)

The [optitrack.md](optitrack.md) file provides a procedure for fusing the position of the OptiTrack system with the PX4's EKF2 module.

### [Borinot bringup](bringup.md)

### [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)

The [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md) file contains a list of known issues and troubleshooting tips to help you quickly resolve problems that may arise during UAM operation.


If you encounter any difficulties during assembly or setup, our [Troubleshooting](resource/troubleshooting.md) section is here to help.

## How to Use Borinot
To use Borinot, we've made a set of guides to help you get started with it:

- [Preflight Checks](resource/preflight.md) - This document contains a checklist of preflight checks that must be performed before operating Borinot to ensure its safety and reliability.
- [Optitrack fusion](resource/optitrack.md) - This document explains how to fuse data from the Optitrack motion capture system and the PX4 flight controller to obtain accurate position and orientation estimates for Borinot.
- [MPC Controller](resource/mpc.md) - This document provides an overview of the Model Predictive Controller (MPC) used to control Borinot's hybrid locomotion, and explains how to run simulations and experiments with the controller.
