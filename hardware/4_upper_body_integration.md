# Upper Body Integration

## 3D part 

### Materials

- 3d parts (spacers)
- nuts M3 (x8)

### Steps

1. clean plastic
2. put nuts

## Airframe Mounting

### Materials

- Main Body
- Airframe
- 3D parts

### steps

1. place the main body on top of the airframe
2. put the spacers betwen the differents carbon fiber tubes
    > :warning: The slots should be facing out.
    > :information_source: The spacer are place at the intersections of the carbon fibers tube (seeing from the top)
    > :information_source: The more distance between two tubes, the bigger the spacers
3. put landing gear interface below each spacers
    > :warning: The slots should be facing out.
4. Tight the airframe to the main body using fasteners
    > :information_source: use the mainbody's inside cavity to hide the head of the fasteners

## Upper Body Routing

> :warning: Patience is key.

### steps

1. Follow the routing schematic (picture showing on which should pass each cable)
2. start by the power cables
3. continue with the signal cables
4. finish with the others
