# Borinot üêù

Borinot is an open-source Unmanned Aerial Loco-Manipulator, developed by the HiDRo group. This torque-controlled robot is designed for hybrid flying and contact loco-manipulation. It utilizes its extremity as a tail for flying locomotion, a hand for agile aerial manipulation, or a leg for hybrid aerial-contact locomotion. You can watch Borinot in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ob7IIVB6P_A).
